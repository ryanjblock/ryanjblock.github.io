<div class="h1">Welcome!</div>

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at Rice University. I study comparative politics, with a focus on mass political partisanship and political parties in Western democracies. 

My work is centered around the idea that citizens in multi-party democracies can develop attachments to and identify with multiple political parties. In my dissertation, I explore the behavioral consequences of these multi-party identities, specifically looking at how they can change patterns of motivated reasoning and strategic voting. I use a wide range of methodological tools in my research, including mass surveys, experiments, and machine learning.
