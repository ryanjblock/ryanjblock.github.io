I study comparative politics, with a focus on political behavior in advanced democracies.\nMy work is centered around the idea that citizens in multi-party democracies can develop attachments to and identify with multiple political parties. In my dissertation, I explore the behavioral consequences of these multi-party identities, specifically looking at how they can change patterns of motivated reasoning and strategic voting. I use a wide range of methodological tools in my research, including mass surveys, experiments, and machine learning."

He gave excellent feedback on papers, graded very fairly, and drove discussions forward with compelling and interesting slideshows.”"

He often took the time to explain things in depth, which helped point me in the right direction on the homework. Ryan is also very patient and understanding when I didn’t get something the first time and needed something repeated. Ryan was also willing to make time to answer quick follow-up questions outside of his office hours if I sent him an email or stuck my head in his office.”\n\n\n“Ryan is a great TA; he always helped clarify difficult material, provided useful resources, and offered insightful feedback on assignments.”\n\n\n“Ryan helped a lot whenever I needed clarification regarding the problems in the question-sets or assistance in how should I proceed with the codes for the analysis. He shared ideas on how should I start thinking about / approach the question when I struggled with finding a starting point to think about how I can analyze the data. Overall, I think his performance as the TA was highly effective.”\n\n\n“Ryan didn’t hesitate to help. He clarified my confusion and encouraged me to do my best.”\n\n\n“Ryan was an extremely effective and helpful TA. During his office hours, and even outside of them if he had the time, he was always willing to help and ensure that we actually learned the concept at hand rather than just give us the answers. While [the instructor] was effective as a professor on his own, Ryan further enhanced the ability of us students to grasp these subjects and succeed in this class.”"
